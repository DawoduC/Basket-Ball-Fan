<h1 style="text-align:center; color:purple">About me and my love for Basketball & American Football</h1>

<p>Hi my name is Charles and the first thing I ever loved in life is basketball and my LA Lakers team!! [Outside family and food ofcourse ;)]</p>

<p style="text-align:left">I've never had a chance to play competitively as I was not aware of any teams until I got into secondary school.
Once I got into secondary and I was aware there was a team I was eager to try-out and play for the school team. <br>I WAS CUT!! :( 
I was not successful in making the team. Gutted I was aspired by a hero of mine MICHAEL JORDAN!
Who also was cut in his 1st year of high school and is now considered the greatest of all time. 
So I continued playing and training whenever I had any free time, and then in year 8 despite still not being in the team for half the season
and opportunity came about when a player was injuired and the team needed a replacement. I was the first person they sought.
Coming off the bench on my first game I balled out, my defense was impeccable, I had so many steals that night and enabled to score double digits in points,
and we won the game. Sidenote I made a kid cry due to the amount of steals I had on him lol</p>

<p>Despite playing well that game, I was very inconsistent, and I was starting to get distracted with activities that I had took upon since yr7
which was turning me into somewhat of a delinquent i.e. gang, fighting, bunking lessons, <br>chasing girls. Then in year 9 I made the decision to 
take basketball more seriously. So I trained everyday before school and after, also joined a local team outside school to assist my development.
My behaviour changed and I was focusing more in school and didn't have time for the extra troubling activities. That year, my school finally made it into the finals,
and despite the loss I was motivated to get back there.
</p>

<p>That moment didn't come around until my last year of secondary school (yr11). The year I was named team captain for the first time. Being team was difficult 
because I was motivated but getting the rest motivated to come in early and train and play hard was close to impossible that year. But I got it done and my play lead
the example as I lead the team in points and rebounds, on our way to the finals. *Remember the kid I made cry* Well I played him and his team in the finals lool!
</p>

<p>It was a close game throughout, leading the team in scoring I made final shot and we was up by three with roughly 5 seconds left. Now this kid *who I made cry*
was a 3pt specialist and he had the ball, my teammate was guarding him. With the shot-clock winding down and I came over to help and the kid took his 3pt shot just I managed to contest,
and he made it!!
</p>

<p>BUT IT WAS TOO LATE! I look over to the ref and he waived it off. The buzzer had went off before he released the ball. MY TEAM WON!! I was the MVP and my team won
it's first ever championship. <br><br>It is momements like this I will never forget. Basketball was everything to me at this point. It saved my life and made me a success.
It taught me so many lessons. 
</p>

<p>And no despite losing, the kid didn't cry unfortunately</p>
